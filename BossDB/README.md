# BossDB_Quarterly_Submission_Receipts
For quarterly BICCN data deliveries to the BossDB Data Archive, manifest files / receipts will be generated that contain the names and paths of the files that were delivered, as well as the associated dates and timestamps of the upload/ingest/delivery. 

Manifest files will typically be compressed (sometimes multiples times) to reduce size on the file system. A GNU compatible file decompression tool will be required to unpack the manifest file. These files can also be accessed from the following location: https://biccn.bossdb.org/
