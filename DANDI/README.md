DANDI receipts:

We generate special receipts for Fischl (DANDI:000026) and Chung (DANDI:000108) U01s.

For each of these datasets, the dashboards indicate what data are available. To see them, you will need to download the files locally and open in a browser since Github does not support

For all other NWB-based dandisets, the PIs and NIH see updates directly on the relevant dataset landing page.
